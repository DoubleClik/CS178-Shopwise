They're the same portabella mushrooms you've enjoyed before, they've just been harvested a few days earlier before becoming those large caps you've seen in vegetarian and vegan cuisines. With their hearty, full-bodied taste, brown mushrooms are an excellent addition to beef, wild game, and vegetable dishes. Plus, mushrooms are a natural source of the antioxidant selenium, making them an excellent addition to your diet. For a natural ingredient that will bring a marvelous taste and texture to your meal, be sure to try out our Fresh Whole Brown Mushrooms.","16-ounce package of whole brown mushrooms Naturally fat free Cholesterol free Low in calories, carbs and sodium Fresh and all natural Pre-cleaned Natural source of the antioxidant selenium Excellent addition to beef, wild game and vegetable dishes",J-M Fresh,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/b2f14768-4ae0-4009-b744-2d974d78534a.047f540f36642a96ffc93b7050eea59b.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/b2f14768-4ae0-4009-b744-2d974d78534a.047f540f36642a96ffc93b7050eea59b.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/b2f14768-4ae0-4009-b744-2d974d78534a.047f540f36642a96ffc93b7050eea59b.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff,,produce

"Ajies Dulce Packed, 8oz",3.47,"Pepper Description: The history of this pepper is obscure, but since wild peppers are naturally hot this variety was probably developed over the years among farmers by simple selection of seed from milder and milder fruits. The fruit of aji dulce can be used green or ripe, and it can be seeded and frozen for use over the winter, a technique that also preserves its rich flavor much better than drying. It is a small, light green pepper that turns red if left long enough on the plant. It has the shape and size of a habanero pepper without the intense heat. In the tropics, this plant can grow as a perennial, although most of the commercial production is with annual systems.",Heirloom Seeds Heirloom Peppers Pepper Seeds Rare Seeds Hot Peppers,Fresh Produce,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c7b43d5a-3b02-4c0e-9301-b68c072b3f87.c91ac586b22683225512667b18038d15.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c7b43d5a-3b02-4c0e-9301-b68c072b3f87.c91ac586b22683225512667b18038d15.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c7b43d5a-3b02-4c0e-9301-b68c072b3f87.c91ac586b22683225512667b18038d15.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff,,produce

"Brad's Atomic Grape Tomato 2 Plants - Rainbow of Color - 3"" Pots",4.99,"Our Favorite tomato! 75 days. Elongated, large cherries in clusters. The color (and flavor!) is a full-blown assault on the senses—lavender and purple stripes, turning to technicolor olive-green, red, and brown/blue stripes when fully ripe. Really wild! Fruits hold well on the vine or off, making this amazing variety a good candidate for market growers. Olive green interior is blushed with red when dead-ripe. Crack-resistant fruits are extraordinarily sweet! Wispy foliage looks delicate but belies these plants’ rugged constitution and high productivity. This release from Wild Boar Farms won best in show at the 2017 National Heirloom Expo! These range some in size from a large grape to plum-sized. AMAZING! TOMATO: Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, and the seeds are high in fiber. The green parts are mildly poisonous, which is not surprising, as tomatoes are closely related to both nightshade and tobacco. The tomato was originally believed to be poisonous when introduced into Europe, and was used solely as an ornamental plant during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Garlic also goes great in creamed soups, on all types of roasts, in a variety of egg dishes, or used simply with sauteed or roasted vegetables. To prepare garlic for cooking, you'll need to break it up into individual cloves and peel the skin. Once you've done this, you can mince the garlic by chopping it into fine pieces. Spice up your next meal with a tasty clove of fresh Garlic.","Must-have pantry staple Flavorful addition to a wide variety of recipes Add to pasta, shrimp, chicken, stews, and more Delivers a bold, pungent flavor when eaten raw but transforms into a lightly sweet and buttery flavor when cooked Explore all the delicious ways to add fresh garlic to your favorite recipes Fresh Garlic",Unbranded,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/dcc7976c-e3ef-4b4a-8eac-251b195f7619.b92c70e94ed37d1f709db94399c898e0.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/dcc7976c-e3ef-4b4a-8eac-251b195f7619.b92c70e94ed37d1f709db94399c898e0.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/dcc7976c-e3ef-4b4a-8eac-251b195f7619.b92c70e94ed37d1f709db94399c898e0.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff,,produce

Daikon,2.84,"Daikon, also called Chinese radish, is an essential ingredient in a wide variety of Asian dishes. The origin of the radish can be traced back to ancient China, but the word Daikon actually comes from two Japanese words: dai (meaning large) and kon (meaning root). As one of the largest radishes, daikon is characterized by its long, narrow appearance and crisp texture. It can range in length from 6 to 15 inches and can average 2 to 3 inches in diameter. The skin is usually white but can also be black. Although it may look similar to a carrot in appearance, its flavor is anything but. It has been described as mildly sweet and juicy with a slightly spicy, peppery bite. This is one versatile Asian vegetable and its fresh flavor is delicious served raw or pickled. It is often used as a condiment, garnish or ingredient in soups, stews, salads and more. Besides enjoying them raw, you can also cook them in many different ways from roasting to steaming and more. They can also be thrown into classic braise with meat, since they absorb their braising liquid beautifully and take on the texture of turnips once cooked. Daikon should be scrubbed with a brush under running water, prior to use.

"Forest-grown Japanese Dried Shiitake KOSHIN, 42-75mm, 70g",29.99,"Sugimoto shiitake are naturally cultivated outdoors on special sweet sap oak logs. Moreover, our drying and packaging process keeps the moisture content to less than 9% which enhances the Shiitake flavor and VitaminD content. Sugimoto Shiitake promotes 100% natural and sustainable cultivation using only carefully selected local cultivators. This Shiitake mushroom is called ?Koshin? and is picked after the cap of the Mushroom blooms into an umbrella. It is more large and flat than the ?Donko? Shiitake mushroom which is picked earlier while the cap is still in a bud form. Since Koshin is less thick than the Donko, it is easier and quicker to use requiring less time to rehydrate. Koshin is best used cut and in stir-fries, soups, sauces, where smaller pieces are used with other ingredients. Our products pass a yearly quality audit guaranteeing the consistency of the sourcing and production process of our Dried Shiitake mushroom. This Audit is conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries with the Japanese Consumers' Co-operative Union.

Garlic also goes great in creamed soups, on all types of roasts, in a variety of egg dishes, or used simply with sauteed or roasted vegetables. To prepare garlic for cooking, you'll need to break it up into individual cloves and peel the skin. Once you've done this, you can mince the garlic by chopping it into fine pieces. Or take the flavor profile to the next level and slice the top off the bulb, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, and roast in the oven. When cool, it makes a delicious spread for crusty French bread or a tasty addition to recipes. Spice up your next meal with a tasty clove of fresh Jumbo Garlic.","Jumbo Garlic, per Pound: Fresh garlic Ideal for pastas, stews, soups, and more Adds delicious flavor to a variety of meals Combine with other fresh herbs to create a gourmet meal Take your culinary creations to the next level",Fresh Produce,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4716545a-144b-4403-90ae-59957d9138e1.3a80708ae95b71cb102d0793e1d47bba.png?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4716545a-144b-4403-90ae-59957d9138e1.3a80708ae95b71cb102d0793e1d47bba.png?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff,https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4716545a-144b-4403-90ae-59957d9138e1.3a80708ae95b71cb102d0793e1d47bba.png?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff,,produce

Mushroom Lion's Mane 4 oz,,"Caputo & Guest Lion’s Mane Mushrooms are among the most distinctive and intriguing gourmet mushrooms, celebrated for their remarkable flavor, nutrition, and appearance. Grown with care by America’s leading domestic grower of exotic mushrooms, these ivory-white clusters feature cascading, icicle-like spines that resemble a lion’s mane—earning their memorable name. With a firm, meaty texture and a delicate, seafood-like flavor often compared to lobster or crab, Lion’s Mane offers a naturally rich, savory taste that enhances both plant-based and protein-forward recipes. Their consistent quality and freshness make them a signature of Caputo & Guest’s chef-inspired collection. Cultivated in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania—the Mushroom Capital of the World—Caputo & Guest’s Lion’s Mane mushrooms are grown on a proprietary, upcycled hardwood sawdust blend that mirrors their natural forest habitat. This sustainable, manure-free substrate supports steady growth, purity, and superior flavor, producing dense, firm mushrooms bursting with umami. Each cluster is hand-harvested at peak maturity, trimmed, and packed to preserve its delicate structure and freshness. The result is a premium ingredient trusted by chefs, wellness enthusiasts, and home cooks alike. When cooked, Lion’s Mane mushrooms develop a golden, lightly crisp exterior with a tender, seafood-like bite and subtle sweetness. Their natural ability to absorb flavors makes them ideal for grilling, sautéing, roasting, or pan-searing. They pair beautifully with butter, olive oil, garlic, miso, soy, and citrus—transforming simple recipes into elevated, restaurant-quality dishes. Whether used as a satisfying meat substitute or as a complement to seafood and pasta, Lion’s Mane delivers refined flavor and texture that fit seamlessly into modern, health-driven cuisine. Nutritionally, Lion’s Mane is a powerhouse of plant-based wellness. Low in calories and fat-free, it’s rich in dietary fiber, protein, and antioxidants. Naturally occurring compounds such as hericenones and erinacines may support cognitive health and memory by stimulating nerve growth factor (NGF). Lion’s Mane also provides potassium, iron, zinc, and essential amino acids—making it a valuable ingredient for consumers seeking nutrient-dense, functional foods. With growing awareness of brain health and “smart foods,” Lion’s Mane has become a star in the gourmet produce category. Caputo & Guest’s growing practices emphasize sustainability, transparency, and quality. By cultivating Lion’s Mane domestically under precisely controlled indoor conditions, the company ensures a consistent, year-round supply while reducing reliance on imports. This local production model shortens the supply chain, lowers carbon footprint, and delivers fresher, better-tasting mushrooms nationwide. Each harvest is carefully monitored for purity, safety, and consistency—upholding the brand’s reputation for excellence. Marketing highlights: • Naturally Brain-Boosting & Cognitive Supportive • Sustainably Grown in the USA • Manure-Free Hardwood Substrate • Excellent Source of Plant-Based Protein & Fiber • Rich, Lobster-Like Flavor • No Artificial Additives or Preservatives Their striking appearance and culinary versatility make Lion’s Mane mushrooms a standout in premium produce, natural foods, and wellness-focused grocery sections.
