Firm, well-shaped, and smooth, these potatoes can be cooked in almost any way imaginable. They have a wonderful, buttery texture and flavor when baked, roasted, boiled, steamed, sauteed, or mashed.

The fruit of aji dulce can be used green or ripe, and it can be seeded and frozen for use over the winter, a technique that also preserves its rich flavor much better than drying. It is a small, light green pepper that turns red if left long enough on the plant. It has the shape and size of a habanero pepper without the intense heat.

Elongated, large cherries in clusters. The color (and flavor!) is a full-blown assault on the senses—lavender and purple stripes, turning to technicolor olive-green, red, and brown/blue stripes when fully ripe. Really wild! Fruits hold well on the vine or off, making this amazing variety a good candidate for market growers. Olive green interior is blushed with red when dead-ripe. Crack-resistant fruits are extraordinarily sweet! Wispy foliage looks delicate but belies these plants’ rugged constitution and high productivity. This release from Wild Boar Farms won best in show at the 2017 National Heirloom Expo! These range some in size from a large grape to plum-sized. AMAZING! TOMATO: Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, and the seeds are high in fiber. The green parts are mildly poisonous, which is not surprising, as tomatoes are closely related to both nightshade and tobacco. The tomato was originally believed to be poisonous when introduced into Europe, and was used solely as an ornamental plant during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first traces of its use as a food date back to the first half of the 18th century. Tomatoes are now a tasty ingredient in many dishes, and are used fresh, canned, stewed or even sun-dried.","Elongated, large cherries in clusters Extraordinarily sweet!

The origin of the radish can be traced back to ancient China, but the word Daikon actually comes from two Japanese words: dai (meaning large) and kon (meaning root). As one of the largest radishes, daikon is characterized by its long, narrow appearance and crisp texture. It can range in length from 6 to 15 inches and can average 2 to 3 inches in diameter. The skin is usually white but can also be black. Although it may look similar to a carrot in appearance, its flavor is anything but. It has been described as mildly sweet and juicy with a slightly spicy, peppery bite. This is one versatile Asian vegetable and its fresh flavor is delicious served raw or pickled. It is often used as a condiment, garnish or ingredient in soups, stews, salads and more. Besides enjoying them raw, you can also cook them in many different ways from roasting to steaming and more. They can also be thrown into classic braise with meat, since they absorb their braising liquid beautifully and take on the texture of turnips once cooked. Daikon should be scrubbed with a brush under running water, prior to use.

Similar to larger Roma tomatoes, grape tomatoes have a lower water content than cherry tomatoes, making them meatier, more flavorful, and even a little tidier with every bite. They are hardier and less fragile than a traditional tomato as well, so there's no need to worry about bruising either.

This vegetable contains essential vitamins such as A and C, and minerals including calcium and magnesium. Red bell pepper, also known as red capsicum, has a crisp flavor that enhances a variety of recipes. Dice bell peppers and put them in a hearty chili, slice them and add to a deli sandwich, saute them with onions and serve on a hoagie roll with a bratwurst, or stir-fry with thinly-sliced steak and serve with rice. A hollowed-out red bell pepper can be filled with sausage, mushrooms and rice to create a delicious stuffed pepper that will have the family asking for seconds. Lunches and dinners are more scrumptious when fresh red peppers are part of the meal. They also taste delicious raw alongside other vegetables. Add your favorite dip for a healthy, crunchy crudite.

The green parts are mildly poisonous, which is not surprising, as tomatoes are closely related to both nightshade and tobacco. The tomato was originally believed to be poisonous when introduced into Europe, and was used solely as an ornamental plant during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first traces of its use as a food date back to the first half of the 18th century. Tomatoes are now a tasty ingredient in many dishes, and are used fresh, canned, stewed or even sun-dried.

Baby bella mushrooms look similar in size and shape to white mushrooms, but they're hardier and provide a deeper earthy taste. They are just like the large portabella mushrooms you know and love but have been harvested just a few days before becoming large enough to fit a burger. This means they have that same firm, meaty texture you love about portabella caps, just in a tasty bite-size form. Pre-cleaned and pre-sliced, their hearty, full-bodied taste makes them an excellent addition to beef, wild game, and vegetable dishes.

Moreover, our drying and packaging process keeps the moisture content to less than 9% which enhances the Shiitake flavor and VitaminD content. Sugimoto Shiitake promotes 100% natural and sustainable cultivation using only carefully selected local cultivators. This Shiitake mushroom is called ?Koshin? and is picked after the cap of the Mushroom blooms into an umbrella. It is more large and flat than the ?Donko? Shiitake mushroom which is picked earlier while the cap is still in a bud form. Since Koshin is less thick than the Donko, it is easier and quicker to use requiring less time to rehydrate. Koshin is best used cut and in stir-fries, soups, sauces, where smaller pieces are used with other ingredients. Our products pass a yearly quality audit guaranteeing the consistency of the sourcing and production process of our Dried Shiitake mushroom. This Audit is conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries with the Japanese Consumers' Co-operative Union.

Baby bella mushrooms look similar in size and shape to white mushrooms, but they're heartier and provide a deep earthy taste. They are just like portabella mushrooms but have been harvested just a few days before becoming large enough to fit a burger. This means they have that same firm, meaty texture you love about portabella caps, just in a tasty bite-size form.

They are perfectly bite-sized which makes them not only ideal in salads and salsas but also perfect as a delicious and convenient snack all on their own. Plus, these small tomatoes also have a longer shelf-life, making it easy to store them for several days at a time and they are hardier and less fragile than a traditional tomato, meaning you no longer have to worry about bruising.

Garlic also goes great in creamed soups, on all types of roasts, in a variety of egg dishes, or used simply with sauteed or roasted vegetables. To prepare garlic for cooking, you'll need to break it up into individual cloves and peel the skin. Once you've done this, you can mince the garlic by chopping it into fine pieces. Or take the flavor profile to the next level and slice the top off the bulb, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, and roast in the oven.

Garlic's signature flavors become caramelized and sweeter when cooked, making it a perfect accompaniment to many dishes such as pasta, shrimp, chicken, stews, and more. Garlic also goes great in creamed soups, on all types of roasts, in a variety of egg dishes, or used simply with sauteed or roasted vegetables. To prepare garlic for cooking, you'll need to break it up into individual cloves and peel the skin. Once you've done this, you can mince the garlic by chopping it into fine pieces.

Grown with care by America’s leading domestic grower of exotic mushrooms, these ivory-white clusters feature cascading, icicle-like spines that resemble a lion’s mane—earning their memorable name. With a firm, meaty texture and a delicate, seafood-like flavor often compared to lobster or crab, Lion’s Mane offers a naturally rich, savory taste that enhances both plant-based and protein-forward recipes. Their consistent quality and freshness make them a signature of Caputo & Guest’s chef-inspired collection. Cultivated in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania—the Mushroom Capital of the World—Caputo & Guest’s Lion’s Mane mushrooms are grown on a proprietary, upcycled hardwood sawdust blend that mirrors their natural forest habitat. This sustainable, manure-free substrate supports steady growth, purity, and superior flavor, producing dense, firm mushrooms bursting with umami. Each cluster is hand-harvested at peak maturity, trimmed, and packed to preserve its delicate structure and freshness. The result is a premium ingredient trusted by chefs, wellness enthusiasts, and home cooks alike. When cooked, Lion’s Mane mushrooms develop a golden, lightly crisp exterior with a tender, seafood-like bite and subtle sweetness. Their natural ability to absorb flavors makes them ideal for grilling, sautéing, roasting, or pan-searing. They pair beautifully with butter, olive oil, garlic, miso, soy, and citrus—transforming simple recipes into elevated, restaurant-quality dishes. Whether used as a satisfying meat substitute or as a complement to seafood and pasta, Lion’s Mane delivers refined flavor and texture that fit seamlessly into modern, health-driven cuisine. Nutritionally, Lion’s Mane is a powerhouse of plant-based wellness. Low in calories and fat-free, it’s rich in dietary fiber, protein, and antioxidants. Naturally occurring compounds such as hericenones and erinacines may support cognitive health and memory by stimulating nerve growth factor (NGF). Lion’s Mane also provides potassium, iron, zinc, and essential amino acids—making it a valuable ingredient for consumers seeking nutrient-dense, functional foods. With growing awareness of brain health and “smart foods,” Lion’s Mane has become a star in the gourmet produce category. Caputo & Guest’s growing practices emphasize sustainability, transparency, and quality. By cultivating Lion’s Mane domestically under precisely controlled indoor conditions, the company ensures a consistent, year-round supply while reducing reliance on imports. This local production model shortens the supply chain, lowers carbon footprint, and delivers fresher, better-tasting mushrooms nationwide. Each harvest is carefully monitored for purity, safety, and consistency—upholding the brand’s reputation for excellence. Marketing highlights: • Naturally Brain-Boosting & Cognitive Supportive • Sustainably Grown in the USA • Manure-Free Hardwood Substrate • Excellent Source of Plant-Based Protein & Fiber • Rich, Lobster-Like Flavor • No Artificial Additives or Preservatives Their striking appearance and culinary versatility make Lion’s Mane mushrooms a standout in premium produce, natural foods, and wellness-focused grocery sections.

Our Broccoli Caesar Roast Kit transforms this beloved flavor into a surprising topping for freshly roasted broccoli florets, which are topped with crispy toasted breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. You may have your new favorite side dish–even better thanks to how easy it is to prepare using this Taylor Farms kit. There's no washing or cutting necessary, and you won’t be whisking a homemade sauce on the stove. This side dish can be ready in under 25 minutes, with most of that time spent waiting for it to cook in the oven—so consider it a bonus of free time. Pair it with grilled or roasted chicken, pan-seared salmon or tilapia, grilled steaks, hearty pastas, or grain-based dishes like risotto, pilaf, or couscous. In addition to being easy comfort food, the Roast Broccoli Caesar Kit is also a great source of Vitamins C and K. One serving provides 5 grams of protein and 2 grams of dietary fiber (thank you, broccoli!). To prepare this side dish kit, simply coat the broccoli in a portion of the included Caesar Sauce (save some for drizzling later!) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread it evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast in a preheated 425°F oven for about 10-15 minutes. Once the broccoli is starting to toast on the edges, remove from the oven. Then sprinkle on the included parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs, and return it to the oven for 2-4 minutes. Then drizzle with the remaining Caesar sauce and enjoy. If you’d rather use your air fryer, no problem. Toss the broccoli in the oil and sauce as described above and roast them in the air fryer for 6 minutes at 375°F. Shake halfway through. Sprinkle on parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs and air fry for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from air fryer and drizzle on the remaining Caesar sauce. Enjoy your toasty, comforting side dish with the perfect crunch and the familiar Caesar zest.","Pre-washed and ready to cook Includes Cassar dressing and toasted breadcrumbs Good source of Vitamins C & K 5 grams of protein per serving Low in carbs","Unbranded","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/69c0f610-6058-46e7-a1df-2207367f04b7.18ae9adfdba68f0ef71cca4bdf282be6.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/69c0f610-6058-46e7-a1df-2207367f04b7.18ae9adfdba68f0ef71cca4bdf282be6.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/69c0f610-6058-46e7-a1df-2207367f04b7.18ae9adfdba68f0ef71cca4bdf282be6.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff","","4.5","Not available","https://goto.walmart.com/c/|PUBID|/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5257647303","976759_976793_8910423"

Pre-cut Brussels sprouts cook to perfection in the air fryer, with a crispy exterior and a tender inside. Tossed in our sweet and spicy maple sauce with a hint of cayenne, these sprouts make a restaurant-quality side dish that's sure to impress. Brussels sprouts are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. A serving of our Spicy Maple Brussels Sprouts provides 140% of the daily value (DV) of Vitamin K, 90% DV of Vitamin C, 4 grams of fiber, and just 90 calories. Wondering how to serve these? Try pairing them with grilled chicken breast & garlic mashed potatoes or baked salmon and wild rice pilaf. We also love the idea of serving them with roasted vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots, or next to a delicate spinach and pear salad. You can also dress them up and play off of the spicy-sweetness in this kit. Top them with bacon crumbles to add a bit of smoky saltiness (and who doesn’t love bacon?). Sprinkle on something sweet to help cut the spice if you prefer, such as chopped dried apricots, dried cranberries, or honey-roasted pecans. If you’re avoiding carbs, you can also make this the base of your main course by adding rotisserie chicken or flaked salmon on top. Delish! To prepare this side dish kit, toss the Brussels sprouts in a neutral oil. Then add them to a pre-heated air fryer and cook for 10 minutes, tossing mid-way. Let them cool when cooked, and then toss them in the provided maple sauce. If you don’t have an air fryer, no problem. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Toss the Brussels sprouts in a tablespoon of oil and roast them in the oven in a single layer for about 20-25 minutes. Once they are becoming crisp on the edges, remove them from the oven and toss in the provided sauce. Serve immediately.","Pre-washed and ready to cook 90 calories per serving Good source of Vitamins K & C","Taylor Farms","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/551ccbff-7093-453e-af12-15360b4a52f9.c087a15467b9e1baf3a542accc143921.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/551ccbff-7093-453e-af12-15360b4a52f9.c087a15467b9e1baf3a542accc143921.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/551ccbff-7093-453e-af12-15360b4a52f9.c087a15467b9e1baf3a542accc143921.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff","","4.0","Not available","https://goto.walmart.com/c/|PUBID|/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5346964234","976759_976793_8910423"

The slicing method depends on your recipe and whether you want the onions to hold their shape or soften easily. Red onions are small to medium in size, averaging 10-15 centimeters in diameter, and are round to slightly oval in shape. The bulb is wrapped in red-purple thin, papery, parchment-like skin that is delicate and easily flakes off when touched. Underneath the skin, there is a burgundy wine-colored sheath that protects the flesh, and the dark purple flesh is firm, crisp, and coarse with many layers of white and purple rings. Red onions are crunchy, pungent, sweet, and slightly spicy when raw and when cooked their flavor lessens and grows mildly sweeter. The intensity of the pungent flavor varies depending on age, particular variety, and the amount of sulfur in the growing soil or the fertilizer used.","Fresh Vegetables Quick to prepare Finely chopped Saves time","Prico Produce LLC","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/1857bfe0-6920-4e6e-8d32-0e77eca8f0fa.c2723b21caf959c6534c2e36ea1e0c92.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/1857bfe0-6920-4e6e-8d32-0e77eca8f0fa.c2723b21caf959c6534c2e36ea1e0c92.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff","https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/1857bfe0-6920-4e6e-8d32-0e77eca8f0fa.c2723b21caf959c6534c2e36ea1e0c92.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff","Red","","Not available","https://goto.walmart.com/c/|PUBID|/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F18415616171","976759_976793_8910423"
